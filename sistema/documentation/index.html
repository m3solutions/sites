		<p>
		  This application is your very own leads and contacts manager.  This tool allows you to keep track of your leads and / or contacts, organize them by Source, Type, or Status so that
		  you can readily view your contacts and track them.  This system is set up to allow multiple users to manage your leads and contacts.  A log keeps track of detailed changes made by 
		  all users which is paginated, searchable and tracks user ip addresses so you know who changed what.  Logins have some extra security built in to include sha1 client side hashing along
		  with server side salt, and all ajax requests and forms require valid session tokens.  There are 2 user roles - admin and user.  Admins have access to the settings tab which lets them change all configurable items (including adding, removing, and 
		  modifying users).  Normal users can edit, add, delete leads, and add or remove notes for the leads.  LCM is highly configurable for your needs, allowing you to create your own Source Groups, Type groups 
		  and Status groups.  Graphical representations on the Statistics page let you quickly see your top Lead Sources, Lead Types, Status counts and trends in lead generation in the last 12 month time period.
		  <ol>
		  <li>Create your own Source, Type, and Status groups</li>
		  <li>Import / Export leads in csv, xls or xlsx format.</li>

		<h3 id="requirements"><strong>Requirements</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
		  Requirements
		  <ol>
		    <li>A webserver (tested to work in a linux hosting environment)</li>
			<li>An unzip program to extract the files</li>
		    <li>PHP 5.2+</li>
			<li>PHP Session support</li>
			<li>PHP PDO Extension</li>
			<li>PHP MYSQL Extension</li>
			<li>MySQL Database 5+</li>
		  </ol>

		<h3 id="install"><strong>Quick Start - Install</strong> - <a href="#toc">top</a></h3>
		<p>
		  To install, extract the zip file on your webserver taking note of the directory you put it in (default folder created is lcm).  Next you will need to create a new
		  MySql Database with your favorite program and take note of the database name, your username and password used.  In phpMyAdmin, here's what creating a database
		  looks like:
		  <br /><img src="assets/images/createDB.jpg" /><br />
		  
		  Once you have created the database, open your browser to www.yoursite.com/lcm/ (or the folder you put it in) where you should be presented with the following screen: 
		  <br /><img src="assets/images/install1.jpg" /><br /> 
		  Insert your database settings, and click 'Test Database', if the installer is able to connect to the database you will be presented with the following screen
		  <br /><img src="assets/images/install2.jpg" /><br /> 
		  At this point just click the 'Run Install' button which will create the tables in your database and config file for you.  LCM will give you the option of downloading
		  the config file (variables.php) in case it is unable to write the file, and it's a good idea to download this file anyways since it contains your settings.  To 
		  download, click the yellow button that says 'Download Variables File'.  If LCM could not write the file all you would need to do in this case is upload the file to your server in the
		  classes directory.  Here is what that screen looks like:
		  <br /><img src="assets/images/install3.jpg" /><br /> 
		  At this time, you can click the 'Login to LCM' and begin working in it.  If you are redirected to the install page again, that means the variables.php file was
		  not written, so you'll need to copy it to the server.  Otherwise you will be presented with the login screen to your fresh install of LCM:
		  <br /><img src="assets/images/install4.jpg" /><br />
		  Default Login is<br />
		  <b>username: admin<br />
		  password: admin</b><br />
		  Now you will want to create your Source, Types, and Status Groups in settings and add your leads either by importing from a spreadsheet or hand entering them.
		  Here are some example Source, Type and Status groups to help you think of what will work for you...
		  </p>

			<li>FaceBook</li>
			<li>Website</li>
			<li>Seminar</li>
			<li>Network Group</li>
			<li>Sign Call</li>
			<li>Other</li>
			<li>Cold Call</li>
